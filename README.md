# stoqcompiler: Toolset for stochastic approximate quantum compilation

The `stoqcompiler` package provides a toolset for stochastic approximate quantum compilation as introduced in [arXiv:2205.13074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13074).

## Installation

The `stoqcompiler` package distribution is hosted on PyPI and can be installed via `pip`:

```
pip install stoqcompiler
```

Alternatively, the package and its requirements can be installed by cloning the repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/rmshaffer/stoq-compiler
cd stoq-compiler
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

For examples of using `stoqcompiler`, see the [example notebooks](./examples) and [unit tests](./tests).
